In sheet 1 i have sorted the sales of chocolate based on countries and i have used bar graph to represent it and then arranged the bar graphn in descending order.

In sheet 2 i have created a table format data given a business summary of total amount of sales and boxes shipped and total shipment of boxes,used format function to bold the data in panes and headers

In sheet 3 i have created a bar graph visualization to find top 10 sales person of buying chocolates
